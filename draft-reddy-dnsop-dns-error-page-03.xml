      <t>When a DNS server filters a query the response conveys no detailed
      explanation of why the query was blocked, leading to end-user confusion.
      This document defines a method to return an URI that explains the reason
      the DNS query was filtered.</t>
    </abstract>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>DNS filters are deployed for a variety of reasons including endpoint
      security, parental filtering, and filtering required by law enforcement.
      These are discussed in more detail below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Various network security services are provided by Enterprise
          networks to protect endpoints (e.g., Hosts including IoT devices).
          Network-based security solutions such as firewalls and Intrusion
          Prevention Systems (IPS) rely on network traffic inspection to
          implement perimeter-based security policies. The network security
          services may, for example, prevent malware download, block known
          malicious domains, block phishing sites, etc. These network security
          services act on DNS queries originating from endpoints. For example,
          DNS firewalls, a method of expressing DNS response policy
          information inside specially constructed DNS zones, known as
          Response Policy Zones (RPZs) allows DNS servers to modify DNS
          responses in real time to stop access to malware and phishing
          domains. Note that some of the commonly known types of malware are
          viruses, worms, trojans, bots, ransomware, backdoors, spyware, and
          adware.</t>

          <t>Network devices in a home network offer network security to
          protect the devices connected to the home network by performing
          DNS-based content filtering. The network security service may, for
          example, block access to specific domains to enforce parental
          control, block access to malware sites, etc.</t>

          <t>ISPs typically block access to some domains due to a requirement
          imposed by an external entity (e.g., Law Enforcement Agency) by
          performing DNS-based content filtering.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>DNS responses can be filtered by sending a bogus ("forged") A or AAAA
      response, NXDOMAIN error or empty answer, or an extended error code
      defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref>. Each of
      these have advantages and disadvantages, discussed below:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The DNS response is forged providing IP addresses that points to
          a HTTP(S) server alerting the end user of the reason for blocking
          access to the domain (e.g., malware). When a HTTP(S) enabled domain
          name is blocked, the network security device presents a block page
          instead of the HTTP response from the content provider. If an HTTP
          enabled domain name is blocked, the network security device
          intercepts the HTTP request and returns a block page over HTTP. If
          an HTTPS enabled domain is blocked, the block page is also served
          over HTTPS. In order to return a block page over HTTPS, man in the
          middle (MITM) is enabled on endpoints by generating a local root
          certificate and an accompanying (local) public/private key pair. The
          local root certificate is installed on the endpoint, and the network
          security device(s) store a copy of the private key. During the TLS
          handshake, the network security device modifies the certificate
          provided by the server and (re)signs it with the private key from
          the local root certificate. <list style="symbols">
              <t>However, configuring the local root certificate on endpoints
              is not viable option in several deployments like Home networks,
              Schools, Small Office/Home Office (SOHO), and Small/ Medium
              Enterprise (SME). In these cases, the typical behavior is that
              the forged DNS response directs the user towards a server hosted
              to display the block page which breaks the TLS connection. For
              web-browsing this then results in an HTTPS certificate error
              message indicating that a secure connection could not be
              established, which gives no information to the end-user about
              the reason for the error. The typical errors are "The security
              certificate presented by this website was not issued by a
              trusted certificate authority" (Internet Explorer/Edge"), "The
              site's security certificate is not trusted" (Chrome), "This
              Connection is Untrusted" (Firefox), &ldquo;Safari can't verify
              the identity of the website&hellip;&rdquo; (Safari on
              MacOS)".</t>

              <t>Enterprise networks do not assume that all the devices
              connected to their network are managed by the IT team or Mobile
              Device Management (MDM) devices, especially in the quite common
              BYOD ("Bring Your Own Device") scenario. In addition, the local
              root certificate cannot be installed on IoT devices without a
              device management tool.</t>

              <t>An end user does not know why the connection was reset and,
              consequently, may repeatedly try to unsuccessfully reach the
              domain. Frustrated, the end user may use insecure interfaces to
              reach the domain, potentially compromising both security and
              privacy. Furthermore, certificate errors train users to click
              through certificate errors, which is poor security practice. To
              eliminate the need for an end user to click through certificate
              errors, an end user may manually install a local root
              certificate <xref target="Chrome-Install-Cert"></xref> on a host
              device. Doing so, however, is also poor security practice as it
              creates a security vulnerability that may be exploited by a MITM
              attack. When the manually installed local root certificate
              expires, the user has to (again) manually install the new local
              root certificate.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The DNS response is forged to provide a NXDOMAIN response to
          cause the DNS lookup to terminate in failure. In this case, an end
          user does not know why the domain cannot be reached, and may
          repeatedly try to unsuccessfully reach the domain. Frustrated, the
          end user may use insecure interfaces to reach the domain,
          potentially compromising both security and privacy.</t>

          <t>The extended error codes Blocked, Censored, and Filtered defined
          in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref> can be
          returned by the DNS server to provide additional information about
          the cause of an DNS error. If the extended error code "Forged
          answer" defined in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref> is returned by the
          DNS server, the client can identify the DNS response is forged and
          the reason for HTTPS certificate error. These extended error codes
          do not suffer from the limitations discussed in (1) and (2) but the
          user still does not know the exact reason nor the user is aware of
          the exact entity blocking the access to the domain. For example, a
          DNS server may block access domain based on the content category
          like "Adult Content" to enforce parental control, "Violence &amp;
          Terrorism" due to an external requirement imposed by an external
          entity (e.g., Law Enforcement Agency), etc. The content categories
          for domains cannot be standardized because the classification of
          domains into content categories is vendor specific, typically ranges
          from 40 to 100 types of categories depending on the vendor and the
          categories keep evolving. Further, the threat data used to
          categorize domains may sometimes mis-classify domains (e.g., Domains
          wrongly classified as DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) by deep
          learning techniques, domain wrongly classified as phishing due to
          crowd sourcing, new domains not categorized by the threat data,
          etc.). The end user needs to know the contact details of the
          IT/InfoSec team to raise a complaint.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>No matter which type of response is generated (forged IP address,
      NXDOMAIN or empty answer, or an extended error code), the user who
      generated the query has little chance to understand which entity
      filtered the query, how to report a mistake in the filter, or why the
      entity filtered it at all. This document describes a mechanism to
      provide a URI which, when accessed, provides such information to the
      user.</t>

      <t>One of the other benefits of this document is eliminating the need to
      "spoof" block pages for HTTPS resources, as the block page no longer
      needs to create a signed certificate when blocking a destination. This
      avoids the need to install an local root certificate authority on those
      IT-managed devices.</t>

      <t>Field definition details:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>OPTION-CODE, 2-octets/16-bits (defined in <xref
          target="RFC6891"></xref>) for Error page URI, value is TBD. [RFC
          Editor: change TBD to the proper code once assigned by IANA.]</t>

          <t>OPTION-LENGTH, 2-octets/16-bits (defined in <xref
          target="RFC6891"></xref>) contains the length of the payload
          (everything after OPTION-LENGTH) in octets. The variability of the
          option length stems from the variable-length ERROR-PAGE-URI and
          ERROR-PAGE-SIG fields.</t>

          <t>ERROR-PAGE-URI-LENGTH, 2-octets/16-bits representing the length
          of ERROR-PAGE-URI. It MUST NOT be set to 0.</t>

          <t>ERROR-PAGE-URI, a variable length UTF-8 encoded <xref
          target="RFC5198"></xref> text field containing the URI Template that
          gives additional information about the cause of blocking access to a
          domain. The ERROR-PAGE-URI field MUST NOT be zero octets in
          length.</t>

          <t>ERROR-PAGE-SIG-ALG, 16-bits, which is the signature algorithm
          used to generate the signature for the Error page URI. The values
          are defined in the TLS SignatureScheme <xref
          target="TLS-SIG-SCHEME"></xref> with limitations described in <xref
          target="signandverify"></xref>.</t>

          <t>ERROR-PAGE-SIG, a variable length field containing the signature
          of the Error page URI. The signature generation process is discussed
          in <xref target="signandverify"></xref>.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The Error page URI option MUST only be included in error responses
      SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN or REFUSED to a query that included the OPT Pseudo-RR
      <xref target="RFC6891"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The URI Template defined in ERROR-PAGE-URI describes how to construct
      the URL to fetch the error page. The agent acting as HTTPS client on the
      endpoint encodes a FQDN to which access is denied into an HTTP GET
      request to retrieve the error page. The HTTPS server returning the error
      page defines the URI used by the HTTP GET request through the use of a
      URI template. The URI Template is processed with a defined variable
      "target-domain" whose value is set to the FQDN to which access is
      denied. The FQDN is encoded with base64url <xref
      target="RFC4648"></xref> and then provided as the variable value for
      "target-domain" to expand the URI Template into a URI reference in the
      HTTP GET request. Padding characters for base64url MUST NOT be
      included.</t>

      <t>An example is illustrated below:</t>

      <t>If the URI template is
      "https://block.example.net/block-page{?target-domain}" for the HTTPS
      server returning the error page and access to the target domain
      "example.com" is blocked by the encrypted DNS server, the variable
      "target-domain" has the value "example.com" base64url encoded into an
      HTTP GET request. In the above example, the expansion of the above URI
      Template is
      "https://block.example.net/block-page?target-domain=ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20".</t>

      <t>HTTP/2 <xref target="RFC7540"></xref> is the minimum RECOMMENDED
      version of HTTP to use to retrieve the error page. The HTTPS client
      retrieving the error page MUST verify the entire certification path per
      <xref target="RFC5280"></xref>. The HTTPS client additionally uses
      validation techniques as described in <xref target="RFC6125"></xref> to
      compare the domain name in the error page URI to the server certificate
      provided in TLS handshake. See <xref target="RFC7525"></xref> for
      additional TLS recommendations.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Error page URL Processing">
      <t>The DNS client MUST follow the following rules to process the Error
      page URI EDNS0 option:<list style="symbols">
          <t>The Error page URI EDNS0 option is susceptible to forgery. In
          order to defend against this attack the DNS client MUST NOT process
          the DNS response with Error page URI EDNS0 option unless DNS
          messages exchanged are cryptographically protected using encrypted
          DNS.</t>

          <t>If an DNS client has enabled opportunistic privacy profile
          (Section 5 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>) for DoT, the DNS
          client will either fallback to an encrypted connection without
          authenticating the DNS server provided by the local network or
          fallback to clear text DNS, and cannot exchange encrypted DNS
          messages. The fallback adversely impacts security and privacy. If
          the DNS client has enabled opportunistic privacy profile for DoT,
          the client MUST NOT process the DNS response with Error page URI
          EDNS0 option.</t>

          <t>If an DNS client has enabled strict privacy profile (Section 5 of
          <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>) for DoT, the DNS client requires an
          encrypted connection and successful authentication of the DNS
          server; this mitigates both passive eavesdropping and client
          redirection (at the expense of providing no DNS service if an
          encrypted, authenticated connection is not available). If the DNS
          client has enabled strict privacy profile for DoT, the client can
          process the DNS response with Error page URI EDNS0 option. Note that
          the strict and opportunistic privacy profiles as defined in <xref
          target="RFC8310"></xref> only applies to DoT protocol, there has
          been no such distinction made for DoH protocol.</t>

          <t>If the DNS response contains more than one Error page URI EDNS0
          option, the DNS client MUST discard multiple Error page URI EDNS0
          options in the DNS response.</t>

          <t>The Error page URI EDNS0 option MUST be processed by the DNS
          client for a "Censored", "Blocked" or "Filtered" extended error
          codes and MUST be ignored for any other type of extended DNS error
          code. When "Censored", "Blocked" or "Filtered" extended error code
          is returned in conjunction with an Error page URI EDNS0 option, any
          other resource records in the answer MUST be ignored by clients
          supporting this specification.</t>

          <t>If the encrypted DNS server does not offer DNS filtering service
          (e.g., prevent access to malware sites or objectionable content
          (e.g., legal obligation)), the DNS client MUST reject the Error page
          URI EDNS0 option. The mechanism discussed in <xref
          target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref> can be used
          by the DNS client to assess whether the encrypted DNS server
          performs DNS-based content filtering.</t>

          <t>If the Error page URI EDNS0 option is included in a NOERROR RCODE
          message, the DNS client MUST reject the Error page URI EDNS0
          option.</t>

          <t>The DNS client MUST reject the error page URI if the scheme is
          not "https".</t>

          <t>The DNS client verifies the signature in the ERROR-PAGE-SIG field
          following the mechanism discussed in <xref
          target="signandverify"></xref>. If the signature is valid, the
          client can positively identify that the Error page URI EDNS0 option
          has been generated by the encrypted DNS server and the encrypted DNS
          server did not forward the Error Page URI EDNS0 option from an
          upstream resolver. If signature validation fails, the DNS client
          MUST reject the Error page URI EDNS0 option.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Because EDNS is a hop-by-hop extension to DNS and EDNS responses are
      not cached (Section 6.2.1 of <xref target="RFC6891"></xref>), a DNS
      resolver MUST NOT propagate a received Error Page URI EDNS0 option,
      because an attacker could insert a bogus URI; instead, if access to a
      domain is denied, the DNS resolver MUST generate its own Error Page URI.
      Because DNS forwarders (or DNS proxies) are supposed to propagate
      unknown EDNS0 options (Section 4.1 and Section 4.4.1 of <xref
      target="RFC5625"></xref>), the Error Page URI EDNS0 option may get
      propagated. To detect both of these scenarios, the Error Page URI is
      protected with an object signature as described in <xref
      target="signandverify"></xref>. </t>

    <section anchor="signandverify" title="Sign and Verify">
      <t>The signature algorithms for generating signature for DNS resource
      record sets (RRsets) are defined in <xref target="DNSKEY-IANA"></xref>.
      The "mandatory-to-implement" algorithms are defined in <xref
      target="RFC8624"></xref> are RSA, ECDSA and EdDSA. Along similar lines,
      the encrypted DNS server's end-entity certificate's public key and the
      signature algorithm with which the key can be used are RSA, ECDSA and
      EdDSA <xref target="RFC8446"></xref>. If ECDSA is used, it is
      RECOMMENDED to use the deterministic digital signature generation
      procedure of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA),
      specified in <xref target="RFC6979"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The signature is generated by the encrypted DNS server using the
      Error page URI, private key of the encrypted DNS server's end-entity
      certificate as inputs to the signature algorithm. The signature
      algorithm in the ERROR-PAGE-SIG-ALG field MUST be compatible with the
      key in the DNS server's end-entity certificate. The implementation MUST
      support the same set of algorithms in the TLS client for validating the
      signature in the CertificateVerify message from the server in the TLS
      handshake and in the DNS client to validate the signature for the Error
      page URI. As a reminder, the server's end-entity certificate's public
      key will be compatible with the selected authentication algorithm from
      the client's "signature_algorithms" TLS extension (Section 4.4.2.2 of
      <xref target="RFC8624"></xref>).</t>

      <t>If the signature algorithm in the ERROR-PAGE-SIG-ALG field is not
      compatible with the key in the DNS server's end-entity certificate, the
      DNS client MUST reject the Error page URI EDNS0 option. The DNS client
      verifies the signature using the signature in the ERROR-PAGE-SIG field,
      error page URI and DNS server's end-entity certificate's public key as
      inputs to the signature algorithm. For example, if Ed25519 is used,
      Ed25519 signature algorithm and verification of the Ed25519 signature
      are described in Sections 5.1.6 and 5.1.7 of <xref
      target="RFC8032"></xref>, respectively.</t>

      user's native language can be used. For example, "Google Translate"
      extension <xref target="Chrome-Translate"></xref> provided by Google on
      Chrome can be used by the user to translate the error page. The "Google
      Translate" extension automatically detects whether the language of a
      page is different from the language the user has selected. If it is in a
      different language, a banner appears at the top of the page. The user
      can click on the Translate button in the banner to have all the text on
      the page appear in the language selected by the user.</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Security considerations in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC8624"></xref> need to be taken into consideration.</t>

      <t>The Error page URI EDNS0 option causes an HTTPS retrieval by the
      client. To prevent forgery of the Error page URI EDNS0 option, this
      specification requires it only be sent only over an encrypted DNS
      channel with an authorized DNS server.</t>

      <t>The DNS client can learn the filtering capability of an encrypted DNS
      server using <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref>. <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref> also discusses
      how a DNS client can authenticate it is connecting to an encrypted DNS
      server hosted by a specific organization (e.g., ISP). This information
      is cryptographically signed to attest its authenticity. It is
      particularly useful when the encrypted DNS server is insecurely
      discovered and prevents the client from connecting to an attacker's
      encrypted DNS server.</t>

      <t>To reduce threat surface when retrieving the Error page URL over
      HTTPS, the client SHOULD perform the retrieval using an isolated
      environment. Such isolation should prevent transmitting cookies, block
      JavaScript, block auto-fill of credentials or personal information, and
      be isolated from the user's normal environment. Browsers perform some of
      these limitations today when accessing captive portals <xref
      target="Safari-Cookie"></xref>, during private browsing, or using
      containerization <xref target="Facebook-Container"></xref>).</t>

      <t>The encrypted DNS session provides transport security for the
      interaction between the DNS client and server, but DNSSEC signing and
      validation is not possible for the Error Page URI EDNS0 option returning
      the error page URI template. For example, if access to a doman is
      blocked, the encrypted DNS resolver can rewrite the response to send
      NXDOMAIN error and Error page URI EDNS0 option in the DNS response, it
      will omit DNSSEC RRsets, because the modified responses cannot be
      verified by DNSSEC signatures. However, the signature in the Error Page
      URI EDNS0 option provides data origin authentication of the Error Page
      URI EDNS0 option. Nevertheless, the Error Page URI EDNS0 option
      returning the error page URI should be treated only as diagnostic
      information and MUST NOT alter DNS protocol processing.</t>

      <t>By design, the object referenced by the error page URL potentially
      exposes additional information about the DNS resolution process that may
      leak information. An example of this is the reason for blocking the
      access to the domain name and the entity blocking access to the
      domain.</t>
