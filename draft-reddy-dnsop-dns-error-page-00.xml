      <t>When a DNS server filters a query the response conveys no detailed
      explanation of why the query was blocked, leading to end-user confusion.
      This document defines a method to return an URI that explains the reason
      the DNS query was filtered.</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>DNS filters are deployed for a variety of reasons including endpoint
      security, parental filtering, and filtering required by law enforcement.
      These are discussed in more detail below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Various network security services are provided by Enterprise
          networks to protect endpoints (e.g., Hosts including IoT devices).
          Network-based security solutions such as firewalls and Intrusion
          Prevention Systems (IPS) rely on network traffic inspection to
          implement perimeter-based security policies. The network security
          services may, for example, prevent malware download, block known
          malicious URLs, block phishing sites, etc. These network security
          services act on DNS queries originating from endpoints. For example,
          DNS firewalls, a method of expressing DNS response policy
          information inside specially constructed DNS zones, known as
          Response Policy Zones (RPZs) allows DNS servers to modify DNS
          responses in real time to stop access to malware and phishing
          domains. Note that some of the commonly known types of malware are
          viruses, worms, trojans, bots, ransomware, backdoors, spyware, and
          adware.</t>

          <t>Network devices in a home network offer network security to
          protect the devices connected to the home network by performing
          DNS-based content filtering. The network security service may, for
          example, block access to specific domains to enforce parental
          control, block access to malware sites, etc.</t>

          <t>ISPs typically block access to some domains due to a requirement
          imposed by an external entity (e.g., Law Enforcement Agency) by
          performing DNS-based content filtering.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>DNS responses can be filtered by sending a bogus ("forged") A or AAAA
      response, NXDOMAIN error or empty answer, or an extended error code
      defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref>. Each of
      these have advantages and disadvantages, discussed below:</t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          <t>The DNS response is forged providing IP addresses that points to
          a HTTP(S) server alerting the end user of the reason for blocking
          access to the domain (e.g., malware). When a HTTP(S) enabled domain
          name is blocked, the network security device presents a block page
          instead of the HTTP response from the content provider. If an HTTP
          enabled domain name is blocked, the network security device
          intercepts the HTTP request and returns a block page over HTTP. If
          an HTTPS enabled domain is blocked, the block page is also served
          over HTTPS. In order to return a block page over HTTPS, man in the
          middle (MITM) is enabled on endpoints by generating a local root
          certificate and an accompanying (local) public/private key pair. The
          local root certificate is installed on the endpoint, and the network
          security device(s) store a copy of the private key. During the TLS
          handshake, the network security device modifies the certificate
          provided by the server and (re)signs it with the private key from
          the local root certificate. <list style="symbols">
              <t>However, configuring the local root certificate on endpoints
              is not viable option in several deployments like Home networks,
              Schools, Small Office/Home Office (SOHO), and Small/ Medium
              Enterprise (SME). In these cases, the typical behavior is that
              the forged DNS response directs the user towards a server hosted
              to display the block page which breaks the TLS connection. For
              web-browsing this then results in an HTTPS certificate error
              message indicating that a secure connection could not be
              established, which gives no information to the end-user about
              the reason for the error. The typical errors are "The security
              certificate presented by this website was not issued by a
              trusted certificate authority" (Internet Explorer/Edge"), "The
              site's security certificate is not trusted" (Chrome), "This
              Connection is Untrusted" (Firefox), &ldquo;Safari can't verify
              the identity of the website&hellip;&rdquo; (Safari on
              MacOS)".</t>

              <t>Enterprise networks do not assume that all the devices
              connected to their network are managed by the IT team or Mobile
              Device Management (MDM) devices, especially in the quite common
              BYOD ("Bring Your Own Device") scenario. In addition, the local
              root certificate cannot be installed on IoT devices without a
              device management tool. </t>

              <t>An end user does not know why the connection was reset and,
              consequently, may repeatedly try to unsuccessfully reach the
              domain. Frustrated, the end user may use insecure interfaces to
              reach the domain, potentially compromising both security and
              privacy. Furthermore, certificate errors train users to click
              through certificate errors, which is poor security practice. To
              eliminate the need for an end user to click through certificate
              errors, an end user may manually install a local root
              certificate <xref target="Chrome-Install-Cert"></xref> on a host
              device. Doing so, however, is also poor security practice as it
              creates a security vulnerability that may be exploited by a MITM
              attack. When the manually installed local root certificate
              expires, the user has to (again) manually install the new local
              root certificate.</t>
            </list></t>

          <t>The DNS response is forged to provide a NXDOMAIN response to
          cause the DNS lookup to terminate in failure. In this case, an end
          user does not know why the domain cannot be reached, and may
          repeatedly try to unsuccessfully reach the domain. Frustrated, the
          end user may use insecure interfaces to reach the domain,
          potentially compromising both security and privacy.</t>

          <t>The extended error codes Blocked, Censored, and Filtered defined
          in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref> can be
          returned by the DNS server to provide additional information about
          the cause of an DNS error. If the extended error code "Forged
          answer" defined in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref> is returned by the
          DNS server, the client can identify the DNS response is forged and
          the reason for HTTPS certificate error. These extended error codes
          do not suffer from the limitations discussed in (1) and (2) but the
          user still does not know the exact reason nor the user is aware of
          the exact entity blocking the access to the domain. For example, a
          DNS server may block access domain based on the content category
          like "Adult Content" to enforce parental control, "Violence &amp;
          Terrorism" due to an external requirement imposed by an external
          entity (e.g., Law Enforcement Agency), etc. The content categories
          for domains cannot be standardized because the classification of
          domains into content categories is vendor specific, typically ranges
          from 40 to 100 types of categories depending on the vendor and the
          categories keep evolving. Further, the threat data used to
          categorize domains may sometimes mis-classify domains (e.g., Domains
          wrongly classified as DGA (Domain Generation Algorithm) by deep
          learning techniques, domain wrongly classified as phishing due to
          crowd sourcing, new domains not categorized by the threat data,
          etc.). The end user needs to know the contact details of the
          IT/InfoSec team to raise a complaint.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>No matter which type of response is generated (forged IP address,
      NXDOMAIN or empty answer, or an extended error code), the user who
      generated the query has little chance to understand which entity
      filtered the query, how to report a mistake in the filter, or why the
      entity filtered it at all. This document describes a mechanism to
      provide a URI which, when accessed, provides such information to the
      user.</t>

      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14
      <xref target="RFC2119"></xref><xref target="RFC8174"></xref> when, and
      only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>

      <t>This document makes use of the terms defined in <xref
      target="RFC8499"></xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-ter"></xref>.</t>

      <t>'DoH/DoT' refers to DNS-over-HTTPS and/or DNS-over-TLS.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Method to return the error page URL">
      <t>The mechanism for providing additional information about the cause of
      blocking access to a domain is from the HTTPS DNS record <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https"></xref>. This HTTPS record in the
      "Service Form" provides the URI that gives additional information about
      the cause of blocking access to a domain. In order to convey an error
      page URI, this HTTPS record SHOULD be returned along with the "Forged
      Answer" extended error code in Extended DNS Error (EDE) EDNS option and
      MUST contain the "eut" (<xref target="IANA"></xref>) name. The service
      parameter key "eut" MUST only be processed by the DNS client for a
      "Forged Answer" extended error code and MUST be ignored for any other
      type of DNS response. When the "forged answer&rdquo; extended error code
      is returned in conjunction with an HTTPS record containing the "eut"
      service parameter key, any other resource records in the answer MUST be
      ignored by clients supporting this specification.</t>

      <t>The following example shows a record containing an error page URI
      template. </t>

      <t><figure align="center" anchor="ex" title="Example 1">
          <artwork><![CDATA[foo.example.com.  7200  IN HTTPS 1 (
   eut=https://block.example.net/block-page={target-domain} )
]]></artwork>
        </figure></t>

      <t>To turn the Error URI Template into a URI, the client replaces the
      string "{target-domain}" in the template with the base64url-encoded
      target domain <xref target="RFC4648"></xref> encoded into an HTTP GET
      request. For example, if the target domain was "example.com" and the
      template was as shown above the URL would be
      https://block.example.net/block-page=ZXhhbXBsZS5jb20K in a GET request.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="ERROR Page">
      <t>The following text outlines the RECOMMENDED contents of an error
      page.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>The exact reason for blocking access to the domain. If the domain
          is blocked based on some threat data, the threat type associated
          with the blocked domain can be provided/displayed to the end user.
          For example, the reason can indicate the type of malware blocked
          like spyware and the damage it can do the security and privacy of
          the user.</t>

          <t>The domain name blocked.</t>

          <t>If query was blocked by regulation, a pointer to a regulatory

          and contact details of the IT/InfoSec team to raise a complaint.</t>

          <t>The blocked error page MUST NOT include Ads.</t>

          <t>The blocked error page MUST NOT include dynamic content.</t>
        </list></t>
    </section>

    <section title="Usability Considerations">
      <t>The error page SHOULD be be returned in the user's preferred language
      as expressed by the Accept-Language header. If the error page is
      displayed in a language not known to the end user and assuming
      Internationalization features failed, browser extensions to translate to
      user's native language can be used. For example, "Google Translate"
      extension <xref target="Chrome-Translate"></xref> provided by Google on
      Chrome can be used by the user to translate the error page. The "Google
      Translate" extension automatically detects whether the language of a
      page is different from the language the user has selected. If it is in a
      different language, a banner appears at the top of the page. The user
      can click on the Translate button in the banner to have all the text on
      the page appear in the language selected by the user.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>Security considerations in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-extended-error"></xref> need to be taken into
      consideration. Unless the DNS response that conveys the URI that
      provides additional information about the cause of blocking access to a
      domain is sent over DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>
      or DNS-over-TLS (DoT) <xref target="RFC7858"></xref>, the DNS response
      is susceptible to forgery.</t>

      <t>DNS client MUST NOT construct and fetch the URL unless DNS messages
      are exchanged over DoT/DoH. Bad actors can host DoT/DoH servers, and
      claim the servers offer privacy and filtering capability to block
      malware domains but exactly do the opposite to invade the security and
      privacy of the end user. For example, this attack can be mitigated if
      the endpoint selects DoT/DoH servers hosted by well-known organizations
      (e.g., ISPs, organization for which a user works, etc.) or the user
      selects DoT/DoH server with filtering capability pre-configured in the
      OS/Browser. The DNS client can learn the filtering capability of a
      DoH/DoT server using <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref>. <xref
      target="I-D.reddy-add-server-policy-selection"></xref> also discusses
      how a DNS client can authenticate it is connecting to a DoH/DoT server
      hosted by a specific organization (e.g., ISP). This information is
      cryptographically signed to attest its authenticity. It is particularly
      useful when the DoH/DoT server is insecurely discovered and prevents the
      client from connecting to an attackers DoH/DoT server.</t>

      <t>The URL providing additional information about the cause of blocking
      access to a domain MUST only serve static content to limit the risk of
      security threats from dynamic content (e.g., malicious Java Script). The
      client MUST reject the URI if the scheme is not "https". DNSSEC signing
      and validation is not possible for the HTTPS record returning the error
      page URI along with the "Forged Answer" extended error.</t>
